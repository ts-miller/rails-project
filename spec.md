    - User has_many :creators, through: :pledges
- [x] Include at least one many-to-many relationship (x has_many y through z, y has_many x through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients, Item has_many Recipes through Ingredients)
    - User
        - has_many :Creators through pledges
    -Creators
        - has_many :Users through pledges
- [x] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute, that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
    - Pledges have the attribute of amount.

        - validates_confirmation_of :password
        - validates :email, uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }
- [x] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)
    - Tier.most_expensive_9 URL:/tiers/most_expensive_9
        -  scope :most_expensive_9, -> { reorder(amount: :desc) }
- [x] Include signup
    - /user/new
- [x] Include login

- [x] Include logout
    - /logout
- [x] Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)

    - User Model
        - SuperUser.from_omniauth(auth)
- [x] Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)
    - users/2/pledges
- [x] Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients/new)
    - /users/pledges/new, /creators/tiers/new
- [x] Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)
    - /users/new
